## Future (Backlog)

### Phase 3: Ruby Interop
- [ ] Design Ruby interop approach for source builds
- [ ] Implement source build support (~5% remaining formulae)
- [ ] Test source build integration

### Testing Improvements (Lower Priority)
- [ ] Large package stress tests (1000+ files like yt-dlp)
- [ ] Resource limit monitoring tests
- [ ] File descriptor leak detection tests
- [ ] Download module tests (parallel downloads, checksum verification)
- [ ] Commands module tests (127 functions currently untested)

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Performance optimizations for large dependency graphs
- [ ] Better error messages for common failure modes
- [ ] Lock file support for reproducibility
