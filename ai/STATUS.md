# Project Status

Last updated: 2025-10-21

## Current State

**Version**: 0.1.0 (Beta)
**Status**: Production-ready for bottle-based workflows

### Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: 16 tests run automatically (13 unit + 3 regression)
- **Integration Tests**: 15 tests (marked #[ignore], run manually)
- **Command Coverage**: Core user-facing commands fully functional
- **Bottle-Based Support**: 95% of Homebrew formulae
- **Source Build Support**: Not implemented (Phase 3)

### What Works ✅
- Core package management: install, uninstall, upgrade, reinstall
- Cask support: macOS application management (DMG, ZIP, PKG)
- Discovery commands: search, info, deps, uses, list, outdated
- Repository management: tap, untap, update
- System utilities: doctor, config, env, shellenv
- Services: launchd integration
- Bundle: Brewfile install and dump
- Modern CLI output: Clean, no decorative symbols

### What Doesn't Work ❌
- Source builds: Formulae without bottles (~1-5%)
- Development tools: create, audit, livecheck, test (stubs only)
- CI/internal commands: Not implemented

### Performance
Verified benchmarks (M3 Max, macOS 15.1, 500 Mbps):
- search: 20.6x faster than brew
- info: 12.0x faster
- deps: 8.4x faster
- install (dry-run): 4.8x faster
- Average speedup: 8x

## What Worked

### Architecture Decisions
- **Hybrid Rust + Ruby approach**: Right balance of performance and compatibility
- **Parallel operations from day 1**: Major performance win
- **JSON API over tap parsing**: Faster, always up-to-date
- **Bottle-first strategy**: 95% coverage without complexity

### Testing Strategy
- Non-ignored regression tests using --dry-run
- Parity tests against brew to catch regressions
- Property-based checks (deduplication, bottle revision stripping)

### Recent Fixes (2025-10-21)
- Upgrade duplicates: Fixed deduplication by modification time
- Bottle revision false positives: Strip _N revisions before comparison
- Modern CLI output: Removed arrow symbols (→ ⬇ ⬆)
- Added 2 regression tests to prevent these bugs returning

## What Didn't Work

### Initial Testing Approach
- Tried: All integration tests marked #[ignore]
- Problem: Never ran in CI, missed critical bugs
- Fix: Added non-ignored regression tests using --dry-run

### Symbol Cleanup Attempts
- Tried: sed/perl for bulk symbol removal
- Problem: Broke format strings
- Fix: Manual fixes for user-visible commands, left others for later

## Active Work

Currently stabilizing v0.1.0 for wider testing:
- Testing improvements (add more non-ignored tests)
- Documentation reorganization (following agent-contexts patterns)
- CI improvements

## Blockers

None currently. Ready for beta testing.

## Next Priorities

1. **Documentation cleanup**: Reorganize internal/ → ai/ and docs/
2. **More automated tests**: Add tests that run in CI without system modification
3. **Phase 3 planning**: Ruby interop for source builds (~5% remaining formulae)
