## ðŸ”´ Critical (Need answers before Phase 1) - âœ… ALL ANSWERED

### 1. Homebrew Prefix & Cellar Paths

**Question**: Where does Homebrew install things? Where should bru install things?

**Why it matters**:
- Must be compatible with existing Homebrew installations
- Users might have both `brew` and `bru` installed
- Installation paths are hardcoded in bottles/receipts

**Need to research**:
- `/opt/homebrew` (Apple Silicon) vs `/usr/local` (Intel)
- Cellar structure: `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/wget/1.21.4/`
- Symlink targets: `/opt/homebrew/bin/wget` â†’ `../Cellar/wget/1.21.4/bin/wget`
- Prefix detection: How to auto-detect user's Homebrew prefix?
- Can we install to same location as Homebrew? (Probably yes)
- What if user doesn't have Homebrew installed? (Create standard prefix)

**Status**: âœ… ANSWERED
- [x] Documented in `homebrew-compatibility.md`
- [x] Prefix: /opt/homebrew (ARM), /usr/local (Intel)
- [x] Detection via arch or HOMEBREW_PREFIX env var

### 2. API Rate Limiting & Caching

**Question**: Will we hit rate limits? Should we cache API responses?

**Why it matters**:
- formulae.brew.sh might rate limit aggressive usage
- Users might run `bru search` repeatedly
- Integration tests hit API many times

**Need to research**:
- Does formulae.brew.sh have rate limits?
- Should we cache API responses locally?
- Where to store cache? (`~/.cache/bru/` or `~/.bru/cache/`)
- Cache expiration strategy?
- Cache invalidation (after `bru update`)?

**Observations**:
- API responses are large (~7MB for all formulae)
- Responses are stable (change only on formula updates)
- `brew` must cache these somehow

**Proposed solution**:
```
~/.cache/bru/
  api/
    formulae.json (cached, 1 hour TTL)
    casks.json (cached, 1 hour TTL)
    formula/wget.json (cached, 1 day TTL)
```

**Status**: âœ… ANSWERED
- [x] Tested: NO rate limits (50/50 requests succeeded)
- [x] Cache for performance, not rate limiting
- [x] Strategy: ~/.cache/bru/ with 1h TTL for lists, 1d for formulae

### 3. Bottle Checksums & Security

**Question**: How do we verify bottle integrity? What checksums does Homebrew use?

**Why it matters**:
- Security: Don't want to install compromised bottles
- Reliability: Detect corrupted downloads
- Compatibility: Must match Homebrew's verification

**Need to research**:
- What hash algorithm? (SHA256? SHA512?)
- Where are checksums stored? (In API response? In bottle?)
- How does Homebrew verify bottles?
- Do we need GPG signature verification?
- What happens on checksum mismatch?

**Status**: âœ… ANSWERED
- [x] SHA256 checksums only (no GPG)
- [x] Documented in `homebrew-compatibility.md`
- [x] Bottles from ghcr.io with HTTPS

### 4. Configuration System

**Question**: Does bru need configuration? Where should it live?

**Why it matters**:
- Users might want to customize behavior
- Need to store API cache location
- Need to store Homebrew prefix override

**Possible config locations**:
- `~/.config/bru/config.toml` (XDG spec)
- `~/.bru.toml` (simple)
- `/opt/homebrew/etc/bru/config` (Homebrew-style)
- Environment variables only (HOMEBREW_* style)

**Possible settings**:
```toml
[api]
cache_dir = "~/.cache/bru"
cache_ttl = 3600  # seconds

[install]
prefix = "/opt/homebrew"  # auto-detect if not set
cellar = "/opt/homebrew/Cellar"
auto_update = false

[network]
concurrency = 10  # parallel downloads
timeout = 30  # seconds

[output]
color = true
verbose = false
```

**Status**: âœ… DECIDED
- [x] No config file for MVP
- [x] Aggressive defaults leveraging speed (see research-conclusions.md)
- [x] Environment variables for power users
- [x] Optional config in Phase 3+ if needed

## ðŸŸ¡ Important (Need answers before Phase 2)

### 5. Installation Receipts Format

**Question**: What format are Homebrew install receipts? Are they compatible with bru?

**Need to research**:
- Receipt location: `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/wget/1.21.4/INSTALL_RECEIPT.json`?
- Receipt format: JSON? What fields?
- Does `brew list` parse these receipts?
- Can bru-installed packages appear in `brew list`?

**Why it matters**:
- Users might want to use both `brew` and `bru`
- Receipts track what's installed
- `brew uninstall` needs to work on bru-installed packages

**Status**: âœ… ANSWERED
- [x] Complete format documented in `homebrew-compatibility.md`
- [x] JSON with full dep tree, timestamps, build environment
- [x] Compatible receipt generation planned for Phase 2

### 6. Tap Management

**Question**: How do taps work? Do we need to support custom taps in Phase 1-2?

**Current understanding**:
- Taps are Git repos with formulae
- Core: homebrew/core (built-in)
- Others: `brew tap user/repo` clones to `/opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/`

**Status**: âœ… ANSWERED
- [x] Modern Homebrew: API-only for core (no git clone!)
- [x] Third-party taps: Still git repos
- [x] Phase 1-2: API-only (matches modern Homebrew)
- [x] Phase 3+: Add tap support if needed

### 7. Keg-Only Formulae Handling

**Question**: How do keg-only formulae work? How should bru handle them?

**What we know**:
- Some formulae are keg-only (not symlinked to prefix)
- Example: `openssl@3` is keg-only to avoid conflicts with system OpenSSL
- Other formulae depend on keg-only formulae

**Questions**:
- How does Homebrew track keg-only status?
- How do dependent formulae find keg-only deps?
- Do we need special handling in Phase 2?

**Status**: âœ… ANSWERED
- [x] Modern Homebrew CHANGED behavior!
- [x] openssl@3, python@3.12 ARE symlinked now
- [x] keg_only flag rarely used
- [x] Simple strategy: check flag, skip symlinks if true

### 8. Dependency Conflict Resolution

**Question**: What happens when two packages need different versions of a dep?

**Homebrew's approach** (from research):
- Forces everything to latest version
- No version flexibility
- Upgrades cascade to dependents

**Should bru be different?**
- Option A: Match Homebrew exactly (simple, compatible)
- Option B: Allow version flexibility (complex, better)

**Status**: âœ… DECIDED
- [x] Phase 1-2: Match Homebrew exactly (force latest)
- [x] Tested: Homebrew forces latest, cascading upgrades
- [x] Phase 4: Consider SAT solver for version flexibility
- [x] Documented in research-conclusions.md

## ðŸŸ¢ Nice to Have (Can research anytime)

### 9. Shell Completions

**Question**: Should bru provide shell completions for bash/zsh/fish?

**Why it matters**: Better UX

**Implementation**: clap can generate completions automatically

**Status**: âœ… ANSWERED
- [x] Clap auto-generates completions
- [x] Trivial to implement (10 lines of code)
- [x] Phase 3-4 priority
- [x] Documented in research-conclusions.md

### 10. Progress Bars for Downloads

**Question**: What progress bar library should we use? How to show parallel downloads?

**Options**:
- `indicatif` (already in Cargo.toml) - great for this
- Show multiple progress bars for concurrent downloads
- Show overall progress

**Status**: âœ… PLANNED
- [x] indicatif already in dependencies
- [x] Phase 2 implementation with parallel downloads
- [x] Show multiple progress bars for concurrent ops

### 11. Homebrew API Alternatives

**Question**: Are there other package metadata sources besides formulae.brew.sh?

**Possible alternatives**:
- Clone homebrew-core repo locally (slow, disk space)
- Use CDN/mirror (faster for some regions)
- Build our own index (overkill)

**Status**: âœ… DECIDED
- [x] Use official formulae.brew.sh API
- [x] No rate limits detected
- [x] Fast with CDN
- [x] Cache for offline support

### 12. Metrics & Telemetry

**Question**: Should bru collect usage metrics? (Homebrew does with HOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS)

**Privacy considerations**:
- Homebrew collects anonymous usage data
- We set `HOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS=1` in our dotfiles optimization
- Users value privacy

**Status**: âœ… DECIDED
- [x] No telemetry in MVP
- [x] Privacy-first approach
- [x] Reconsider in Phase 4+ with opt-in only

## Research Methodology

When researching answers:

1. **Check Homebrew source code**:
   - https://github.com/Homebrew/brew
   - Focus on: `Library/Homebrew/`
   - Key files: `formula.rb`, `installer.rb`, `cellar.rb`

2. **Test with real Homebrew**:
   ```bash
   brew install wget --verbose
   brew info wget --json
   ls -la /opt/homebrew/Cellar/wget/
   ```

3. **Read Homebrew docs**:
   - https://docs.brew.sh/
   - https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook
   - https://docs.brew.sh/Installation

4. **Test edge cases**:
   - What if Homebrew isn't installed?
   - What if prefix is custom?
   - What if network is slow/offline?

5. **Document findings**:
   - Create new docs in `internal/` as needed
   - Update `CLAUDE.md` with important decisions
   - Add to roadmap if implementation is needed
