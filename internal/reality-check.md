# Reality Check: What Actually Works

**Generated**: October 14, 2025
**Purpose**: Honest assessment of what's implemented vs what's claimed

## Executive Summary

**Claims**: 100% command parity, 77% tested, production ready for 95% of use cases

**Reality**: Many features are partially implemented or untested. Need to fix or remove incomplete features.

---

## Cask Support Reality ⚠️

### What We Claim
> "Cask support - DMG, ZIP, PKG installation (tested & working)"
> "Installing/managing casks (GUI apps)"

### What Actually Works

**Formats:**
- ✅ .dmg - Fully working (mount, copy app, unmount)
- ✅ .zip - Fully working (extract, copy app)
- ✅ .pkg - Implemented but **UNTESTED** (requires sudo)
- ❌ .tar.gz / .tgz - **NOT IMPLEMENTED** (line 3388: "Unsupported file type")

**Artifacts:**
- ✅ "app" artifacts only
- ❌ "binary" artifacts - **NOT IMPLEMENTED** (CLI tools installed via casks)
- ❌ "suite" artifacts - **NOT IMPLEMENTED** (app bundles with multiple apps)
- ❌ "pkg" artifacts - **NOT IMPLEMENTED** (pkg as artifact vs download)
- ❌ "installer" artifacts - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- ❌ "uninstall" scripts - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- ❌ "zap" scripts - **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

### Impact

**Casks that WON'T work:**
- tar.gz casks: alfred, agentkube, aqua-data-studio, arm-performance-libraries, etc.
- Binary artifacts: any cask that installs CLI tools (need examples)
- Suite artifacts: any cask with multiple apps in one package

**Estimated coverage**: ~60-70% of casks work, not 95%+

## Bottle Installation Reality

### What We Claim
> "Install, uninstall, upgrade, reinstall - Bottle-based formulae"
> "Full dependency resolution and graph traversal"

### What's Actually Tested

**Tested:**
- ✅ Simple package install (hello, tree, wget)
- ✅ Package with dependencies (tested implicitly)
- ✅ Uninstall
- ✅ Reinstall
- ✅ Upgrade

**Tested (2025-10-21):**
- ✅ Keg-only formulae (sqlite, readline, ncurses) - Working, status displayed in info
- ✅ Formulae with 10+ dependencies (node: 12 deps, ffmpeg: 44 deps) - Working correctly
- ✅ Multi-level dependency resolution (ffmpeg → aom → jpeg-xl, libvmaf) - Working

**Untested:**
- ⚠️ Formulae with circular dependency patterns
- ⚠️ Concurrent installs (race conditions?)
- ⚠️ Failed download recovery
- ⚠️ Corrupt bottle handling
- ⚠️ Conflicting formula installs

### Known Issues from Testing (2025-10-21)

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Error handling: Commands showed ugly stack traces for non-existent formulae - FIXED
- ✅ Keg-only support: Missing from API/display - FIXED
- ✅ Partial failure handling: Single non-existent formula caused entire install to fail - FIXED

**Remaining:**
- ⚠️ No partial progress reporting during dependency resolution (future enhancement)

---

## Commands: Implemented vs Functional

### Fully Functional (Tested & Verified)
- Core bottle installs: install, uninstall, upgrade, reinstall
- Discovery: search, info, desc, deps, uses, list, leaves
- Repository: tap, untap, tap-info, tap-new, update
- System: config, doctor, env, cache, analytics
- Bundle: bundle, bundle dump

### Partially Functional (Implemented but Incomplete)
- ⚠️ Cask operations (missing tar.gz, binary, suite artifacts)
- ⚠️ Services (implemented, lightly tested)
- ⚠️ Cleanup --cask (tested, but doesn't handle all artifact types)

### Stubs Only (Not Functional)
- All Phase 3 commands (test, bottle, ruby, irb, etc.)
- All CI commands (bump-*, pr-*, generate-*, etc.)

---

## Testing Coverage Reality

### What We Claim
> "77% tested (89/116 commands)"

### What This Actually Means

**"Tested" includes:**
- Commands that show proper informational output (stubs)
- Commands run once without crashing
- Commands that timed out but "probably work"

**NOT tested:**
- Edge cases
- Error handling
- Recovery scenarios
- Concurrent operations
- Network failures

**True comprehensive testing**: ~40-50% of commands

---

## Performance Claims Reality

### What We Claim (from README)
> "7-60x faster than Homebrew"
> "15-100x less CPU usage"

### What's Actually Benchmarked

**Phase 0 (read-only):**
- ✅ `bru info`: 7.2x faster (verified)
- ✅ `bru search`: Same speed, 15x less CPU (verified)

**Phase 2 (installation):**
- ✅ `bru install`: 21-60x faster (verified on simple packages)

**NOT benchmarked:**
- Complex installations (10+ dependencies)
- Cask operations
- Upgrade operations
- Real-world workflows
- Network-constrained environments

---

## Critical Missing Features

### Must Fix Before Beta
1. **tar.gz cask support** - Many popular casks use this format
2. **binary artifacts** - CLI tools installed via casks
3. **PKG testing** - Never actually tested with real PKG
4. **Error handling** - No comprehensive error scenario testing

### Should Fix Before v1.0
1. suite artifacts
2. Keg-only formula testing
3. Complex dependency scenarios
4. Concurrent operation safety
5. Network failure recovery

### Nice to Have
1. Phase 3 (Ruby interop)
2. All CI commands functional
3. Formula development workflow

## Honest Assessment

### For End Users (Bottle-based)
**Claim**: Production ready for 95% of use cases
**Reality**: Production ready for ~70-80% of bottle use cases
- Works great for simple formulae
- Works for basic casks (dmg/zip apps)
- Untested for edge cases
- Missing tar.gz casks
- Missing binary/suite artifacts

### For Cask Users
**Claim**: Full cask support
**Reality**: Partial cask support (~60-70%)
- ✅ DMG apps (Rectangle, etc.)
- ✅ ZIP apps (AltTab, etc.)
- ❌ TAR.GZ apps (Alfred, etc.)
- ❌ Binary artifacts (CLI tools)
- ❌ Suite artifacts (multi-app bundles)

### For Formula Developers
**Claim**: Not ready (awaits Phase 3)
**Reality**: Correct - completely non-functional

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Be honest in README** - Update claims to match reality
2. **Add tar.gz support** - Critical for cask compatibility
3. **Add binary artifact support** - Critical for cask compatibility
4. **Test PKG casks** - Never actually verified
5. **Comprehensive edge case testing** - Find the bugs

### Version Labeling
- Current: v0.0.1 (Alpha, not Beta)
- Beta ready when: tar.gz + binary artifacts + edge case testing
- v1.0 ready when: All features bulletproof + Phase 3

---

## Test Plan: Make It Bulletproof

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Gaps (1-2 days)
- [ ] Implement tar.gz extraction
- [ ] Implement binary artifact installation
- [ ] Test PKG casks (find a real one, test it)
- [ ] Test keg-only formulae

### Phase 2: Edge Cases (2-3 days)
- [ ] Complex dependency trees (test node, python, rust toolchains)
- [ ] Network failure scenarios
- [ ] Corrupt cache scenarios
- [ ] Concurrent operations
- [ ] Conflicting formulae

### Phase 3: Error Handling (1-2 days)
- [ ] Download failures
- [ ] Extraction failures
- [ ] Installation failures
- [ ] Rollback scenarios
- [ ] Helpful error messages

### Phase 4: Real-World Usage (1 week)
- [ ] Daily driver test (use bru instead of brew)
- [ ] Install 50+ packages
- [ ] Upgrade workflows
- [ ] Brewfile workflows
- [ ] Document all issues found

---

## Bottom Line

**Status**: Alpha, not Beta

**What works well**:
- Simple bottle installs
- DMG/ZIP casks
- Discovery commands
- Repository management

**What needs work**:
- Complete cask support (tar.gz, binary, suite)
- Edge case testing
- Error handling
- Performance validation on complex scenarios

**Recommendation**: Fix critical gaps (tar.gz + binary artifacts), do comprehensive edge case testing, THEN call it Beta.
