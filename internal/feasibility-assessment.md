# Feasibility Assessment: Is Kombrucha Achievable?

## TL;DR

**Yes, absolutely achievable.** The MVP (bottle-only package manager) is 8 weeks part-time and delivers 10x+ speedup. Full Homebrew replacement is 20 weeks part-time.

## Why This Is Feasible

### 1. We're Not Rewriting Homebrew

**What we're NOT doing**:
- ❌ Rewriting 15+ years of formulae
- ❌ Rebuilding bottle infrastructure
- ❌ Maintaining formula repositories
- ❌ Running build bots
- ❌ Managing community contributions to formulae

**What we ARE doing**:
- ✅ Building a fast API client
- ✅ Implementing parallel downloads
- ✅ Creating a dependency resolver
- ✅ Managing local installations
- ✅ (Phase 3) Executing existing Ruby formulae

**Key Insight**: We leverage 99% of Homebrew's infrastructure. We're just building a faster client.

### 2. The Hard Parts Are Solved Problems

| Challenge | Solution | Complexity |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| JSON API client | `reqwest` + `serde` | Trivial |
| Parallel downloads | `tokio` + `futures` | Easy |
| Archive extraction | `tar` + `flate2` crates | Easy |
| CLI parsing | `clap` derive macros | Trivial |
| Progress bars | `indicatif` crate | Easy |
| Dependency resolution | Well-studied algorithms | Medium |
| Ruby embedding | `magnus` crate | Medium-Hard |

**Nothing here is research-level difficulty.** All are solved problems with good Rust crates.

### 3. MVP Doesn't Need Ruby

**Bottle coverage** (packages with pre-built binaries):
- macOS ARM64 (M1/M2/M3): ~95% of core formulae
- macOS Intel: ~90% of core formulae
- Linux: ~80% of core formulae

**For Phase 1-2 MVP**:
- No Ruby interpreter needed
- No source builds needed
- Just downloads + extraction
- Handles 80-95% of real-world installs

**Ruby can wait until Phase 3** after we've proven value.

### 4. We Can Start Small and Ship Value Early

**Week 2**: `bru search` works and is 3x faster
**Week 4**: `bru deps --tree` shows beautiful dependency graphs
**Week 6**: `bru fetch` downloads bottles in parallel
**Week 8**: `bru install` works for bottles and is 10x faster

Each step ships value and validates the approach.

### 5. The Rust Ecosystem Is Mature

**Everything we need exists**:
- Async runtime: `tokio` (battle-tested)
- HTTP client: `reqwest` (used by millions)
- JSON: `serde` (industry standard)
- CLI: `clap` (best-in-class)
- Archive handling: `tar`, `flate2` (solid)
- Testing: `cargo test` built-in
- Benchmarking: `criterion` crate

**No pioneering required.** We're combining proven tools.

### 6. Similar Projects Exist

**Proof points**:
- **uv** (Python package manager): Replaced pip/poetry, 10-100x faster, written in Rust
- **bun** (JS runtime/package manager): Replaced npm/yarn, 10x+ faster
- **ripgrep**: Replaced grep, 10x+ faster
- **fd**: Replaced find, 5-10x faster
- **exa/eza**: Replaced ls, faster + prettier

**Pattern**: Rewriting Unix tools in Rust consistently yields 5-100x speedups.

**Homebrew-specific**:
- **pkgx**: Max Howell's new project (Homebrew creator), written in Rust
- **sp**: Rust-based Homebrew alternative (uses Homebrew API)

These prove the approach works.

## Detailed Feasibility by Phase

### Phase 0: Foundation ✅ VERY FEASIBLE

**Complexity**: Low
**Time**: 1-2 weeks
**Risk**: None

This is standard Rust project setup. Thousands of tutorials exist.

### Phase 1: Read-Only Commands ✅ VERY FEASIBLE

**Complexity**: Low
**Time**: 2-3 weeks
**Risk**: Low

- HTTP + JSON parsing: solved problem
- Parallel fetching: tokio makes this trivial
- Output formatting: well-supported crates

**Code estimate**: ~2,000 lines

**Example** (parallel search):
```rust
use tokio;
use reqwest;

async fn search(query: &str) -> Vec<Formula> {
    let (formulae, casks) = tokio::join!(
        fetch_formulae_api(),
        fetch_cask_api()
    );

    filter_results(query, formulae, casks)
}
```

That's it. Tokio handles parallelism.

### Phase 2: Bottle Installation ✅ FEASIBLE

**Complexity**: Medium
**Time**: 3-4 weeks
**Risk**: Medium-Low

**Challenges**:
1. **Symlink management**: Read Homebrew docs, test carefully
2. **Cellar structure**: Well-documented
3. **Install receipts**: JSON files, easy to generate
4. **Checksums**: SHA256, built into Rust

**Code estimate**: ~5,000 lines

**Risk mitigation**:
- Test with simple packages first (wget, curl)
- Gradually add complex packages
- Compare against Homebrew installs
- Add extensive integration tests

**This is the hardest part of MVP**, but still straightforward file manipulation.

### Phase 3: Source Builds ⚠️ MODERATE FEASIBILITY

**Complexity**: Medium-High
**Time**: 3-4 weeks
**Risk**: Medium

**Challenges**:
1. **Ruby embedding**: `magnus` crate exists but requires careful memory management
2. **Formula DSL**: Need to evaluate Ruby code safely
3. **Build environments**: Must handle compiler toolchains
4. **Error handling**: Ruby exceptions → Rust errors

**Why still feasible**:
- `magnus` is mature and well-documented
- We only need to evaluate formulae, not modify Ruby
- Homebrew's formula DSL is well-defined
- Lots of examples in magnus docs

**Code estimate**: ~3,000 lines

**Risk mitigation**:
- Start with simple formulae (pure Ruby, no complex build)
- Test against common source-only packages
- Have fallback: "use brew for source builds" for MVP+1

### Phase 4: Advanced Features ✅ FEASIBLE

**Complexity**: Medium
**Time**: 3-4 weeks
**Risk**: Low

These are all optional enhancements. Nothing critical.

**SAT solver**:
- `resolvo` crate exists (libsolv bindings)
- Or implement simpler backtracking solver
- Can start without this and add later

**Lock files**:
- Just serialize resolved versions to JSON
- Load and use for installs
- Straightforward

### Phase 5: Polish ✅ VERY FEASIBLE

**Complexity**: Low-Medium
**Time**: 3-4 weeks
**Risk**: None

Standard release engineering. Documentation, CI/CD, packaging.

## Resource Requirements

### Time Investment

**MVP (Phases 0-2)**:
- Part-time (20h/week): 8 weeks = 160 hours

- We leverage more: entire Homebrew infrastructure
- Our MVP is smaller scope
- **Kombrucha should be easier**

### ripgrep (grep replacement)

**Stats**:
- Lines of code: ~30,000
- Development time: ~6 months (solo)
- Result: 10x+ faster than grep

**Kombrucha vs ripgrep**:
- Similar complexity for core features
- We have more infrastructure to build
- But also more existing infrastructure to leverage
- **Similar difficulty**

### Homebrew itself

**Stats**:
- Lines of code: ~100,000+ Ruby
- Development time: 15 years
- Contributors: 1000+

**But remember**: We're not rewriting Homebrew!

**Kombrucha scope**:
- Lines of code estimate: ~15,000 for full replacement
- We reuse: formulae, bottles, API, taps, build infrastructure
- We only build: client-side tooling

## Critical Success Factors

## Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

### ✅ GO IF:
- [x] You enjoy systems programming
- [x] You want to learn Rust/async/package management
- [x] You're okay with 160+ hours of work for MVP
- [x] You're excited about 10x performance improvements
- [x] You'll use it yourself (dogfooding)

### 🛑 NO-GO IF:
- [ ] You need immediate commercial success
- [ ] You can't commit 20h/week for 8 weeks
- [ ] You hate debugging installation issues
- [ ] You're not comfortable with Rust
- [ ] You won't use it yourself

## Recommendation

### For MVP (Phases 0-2): 🚀 DEFINITELY DO IT

**Reasons**:
1. **Clear value proposition**: 10x faster installs
2. **Achievable scope**: 160 hours, well-defined
3. **Low risk**: No Ruby needed, proven technologies
4. **Learning opportunity**: Async Rust, systems programming
5. **Immediate dogfooding**: Use it yourself daily
6. **Proof of concept**: Validates or refutes thesis

**Even if you stop at MVP**, you'll have:
- A useful tool for yourself
- Portfolio project showcasing Rust skills
- Deep understanding of package management
- Proof that parallelism > Ruby overhead

### For Full Release (All Phases): ✅ DO IT IF MVP SUCCEEDS

**Gate on MVP success**:
1. Does MVP achieve 10x speedup? (Should: yes)
2. Are there bugs that break installs? (Hope: no)
3. Is it actually nicer to use? (Should: yes)
4. Is there community interest? (Check early)

**If MVP succeeds**, the rest is incremental improvement.

### For Commercial Venture: 🤔 MAYBE

**Opportunities**:
- Workbrew (Mike McQuaid) commercialized Homebrew
- pkgx (Max Howell) is a startup
- Could offer: enterprise features, support, managed packages

**But don't build for this**. Build because:
- You want it to exist
- You'll use it yourself
- It's fun to build

## Conclusion

**Is Kombrucha achievable?**

**YES.**

- ✅ Technical feasibility: High
- ✅ Resource feasibility: Reasonable (160h for MVP)
- ✅ Value proposition: Clear (10x+ speedup)
- ✅ Risk: Manageable (start small, ship incrementally)
- ✅ Leverage: High (reuse entire Homebrew ecosystem)

**The MVP is definitely achievable as a side project.**

**The full replacement is achievable with sustained effort.**

**You're not crazy for wanting to do this.** The Homebrew maintainers were wrong about network dominance on modern networks. Parallel operations + compiled code = massive speedup.

Let's prove them wrong. 🚀
