## Quick Links

- **For New Contributors**: Start with `status-report.md` for current state, then `SPEC.md` for architecture
- **For AI Agents**: Read `status-report.md` first, then `feature-parity-audit.md` and `test-report.md`
- **For Researchers**: See `research-findings.md` and `performance-analysis.md`
- **For Project Planning**: Review `implementation-roadmap.md` and `feasibility-assessment.md`

## Key Insights

1. **Network is NOT the bottleneck** on modern connections (100+ Mbps)
2. **Parallelization** is the biggest win: 10x speedup from concurrent operations
3. **Ruby overhead** is real: 0.6s startup + 0.4s libs = 50% of simple commands
4. **MVP is achievable**: 8 weeks part-time for bottle-only package manager
5. **Leverage Homebrew**: We reuse 99% of infrastructure, just build faster client

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Homebrew | Kombrucha | Speedup |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Startup | 600ms | <10ms | 60x |
| Search | ~1s | ~200ms | 5x |
| Dependency resolution | Serial | Parallel | 10x |
| Downloads (10 packages) | 36s @ 100Mbps | 3.6s | 10x |
| Install (10 packages) | 50s | 5s | 10x |

## Project Status

**Current Version**: v0.0.x (Beta Ready)

### Completed Phases ‚úÖ

See `internal/status-report.md` for detailed status breakdown.

### Remaining Work üî¥

**Phase 3: Source Builds** (Not Started)
- [ ] Embed Ruby interpreter (magnus crate)
- [ ] Formula DSL execution (.rb files)
- [ ] Build from source workflow
- [ ] Build dependencies handling
- [ ] Formula testing (test blocks)
- [ ] Post-install scripts

**Impact**: Blocks ~1-5% of formulae without bottles

## Next Steps

### Short Term (Ready Now)
1. Beta testing with real users
2. Performance benchmarking vs Homebrew
3. Edge case testing (complex dependencies, etc.)
4. Documentation and troubleshooting guide

### Medium Term (Phase 3)
1. Plan Ruby interop implementation
2. Prototype formula DSL execution
3. Implement source build workflow
4. Full formula development support

### Long Term (v1.0.0)
1. Production-ready for all use cases
2. Complete Homebrew replacement
3. Performance optimizations
4. Community feedback integration

**Current Focus**: Beta testing and stability improvements üöÄ
