# Internal Documentation

This directory contains internal documentation, research, and AI agent instructions for the Kombrucha project.

## Documents

### Research & Analysis

**`research-findings.md`**
- Deep dive into Homebrew's performance bottlenecks
- Dependency management issues analysis
- Modern package manager best practices
- Specific opportunities for Kombrucha
- Community feedback from GitHub issues

**`performance-analysis.md`**
- Mathematical breakdown of where time is spent
- Proof that Homebrew maintainers are wrong about "network dominance" on modern networks
- Performance scenarios for different network speeds
- Expected speedups: 10-20x on fast networks
- Comparison of sequential vs parallel approaches

### Planning

**`implementation-roadmap.md`**
- Complete phase-by-phase implementation plan
- Timeline: 8 weeks for MVP, 20 weeks for full release
- Technical architecture and project structure
- Success metrics for each phase
- Risk mitigation strategies

**`feasibility-assessment.md`**
- Detailed analysis: Is this project achievable?
- Answer: YES (MVP in 160 hours)
- Comparison with similar projects (uv, ripgrep)
- Go/No-Go decision criteria
- Next concrete steps

## Quick Links

- **For AI Agents**: Read all files to understand project scope and constraints
- **For Contributors**: Start with `feasibility-assessment.md`, then `implementation-roadmap.md`
- **For Researchers**: See `research-findings.md` and `performance-analysis.md`

## Key Insights

1. **Network is NOT the bottleneck** on modern connections (100+ Mbps)
2. **Parallelization** is the biggest win: 10x speedup from concurrent operations
3. **Ruby overhead** is real: 0.6s startup + 0.4s libs = 50% of simple commands
4. **MVP is achievable**: 8 weeks part-time for bottle-only package manager
5. **Leverage Homebrew**: We reuse 99% of infrastructure, just build faster client

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Homebrew | Kombrucha | Speedup |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Startup | 600ms | <10ms | 60x |
| Search | ~1s | ~200ms | 5x |
| Dependency resolution | Serial | Parallel | 10x |
| Downloads (10 packages) | 36s @ 100Mbps | 3.6s | 10x |
| Install (10 packages) | 50s | 5s | 10x |

## Project Status

**Phase 0: COMPLETE âœ…**

- [x] Research completed
- [x] Performance analysis done
- [x] Implementation roadmap created
- [x] Feasibility validated
- [x] Project initialized (cargo init)
- [x] CLI scaffolding with clap
- [x] Basic commands structure (search, info, deps)
- [x] First feature implemented (search, info, deps working!)
- [x] Benchmarked vs Homebrew: **7x faster** for info, **15x less CPU** for search
- [ ] Phase 1: Dependency resolution
- [ ] Phase 2: Bottle downloads and installation
- [ ] MVP shipped (Phase 2 complete)

## Next Steps

1. Initialize Rust project with workspace structure
2. Implement JSON API client
3. Build `bru search` command and benchmark
4. Prove 3-5x speedup on first feature
5. Continue with roadmap Phase 1

Let's build this! ðŸš€
