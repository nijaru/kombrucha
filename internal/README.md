## Quick Links

- **For New Contributors**: Start with `session-2025-10-21-edge-testing.md` for latest work, then `status-report.md` for overall state, then `SPEC.md` for architecture
- **For AI Agents**: Read `session-2025-10-21-edge-testing.md` first for current context, then `testing-strategy.md`, `reality-check.md`, and `status-report.md`
- **For Researchers**: See `research-findings.md` and `performance-analysis.md`
- **For Project Planning**: Review `implementation-roadmap.md` and `feasibility-assessment.md`
- **For UX Work**: See `ux-analysis.md` and `emoji-cleanup-systematic-approach.md`

## Key Insights

1. **Network is NOT the bottleneck** on modern connections (100+ Mbps)
2. **Parallelization** is the biggest win: 10x speedup from concurrent operations
3. **Ruby overhead** is real: 0.6s startup + 0.4s libs = 50% of simple commands
4. **MVP is achievable**: 8 weeks part-time for bottle-only package manager
5. **Leverage Homebrew**: We reuse 99% of infrastructure, just build faster client

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Homebrew | Kombrucha | Speedup |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Startup | 600ms | <10ms | 60x |
| Search | ~1s | ~200ms | 5x |
| Dependency resolution | Serial | Parallel | 10x |
| Downloads (10 packages) | 36s @ 100Mbps | 3.6s | 10x |
| Install (10 packages) | 50s | 5s | 10x |

## Project Status

- [x] Bundle/Brewfile support
- [x] Cleanup and autoremove
- [x] Pin/unpin functionality

**Phase 4: Core Command Implementation** ‚úÖ
- [x] Core package management fully functional
- [x] Repository management (tap, update, extract, etc.)
- [x] System utilities and diagnostics
- [ ] Development tools (create, audit, livecheck, etc.) - stubs only
- [ ] CI/internal commands - not implemented

### Current Metrics üìä

- **Core Commands**: Fully functional (install, uninstall, upgrade, search, info, etc.)
- **Testing Coverage**: 32 automated tests (unit + integration)
- **Bottle-Based Workflows**: Production ready (95% of formulae)
- **Source Builds**: Not yet supported
- **Status**: **BETA** ‚úÖ

See `internal/status-report.md` for detailed status breakdown.

### Remaining Work üî¥

**Phase 3: Source Builds** (Not Started)
- [ ] Embed Ruby interpreter (magnus crate)
- [ ] Formula DSL execution (.rb files)
- [ ] Build from source workflow
- [ ] Build dependencies handling
- [ ] Formula testing (test blocks)
- [ ] Post-install scripts

**Impact**: Blocks ~1-5% of formulae without bottles
