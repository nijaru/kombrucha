# v0.1.15 - UX & Quality Improvements

This release focuses on user experience enhancements and comprehensive testing to ensure the reliability of our parallel operations.

## ðŸŽ¨ UX Improvements

### Live Progress Display
- **Parallel tap updates now show results as they complete** - No more waiting for all taps to finish before seeing output
- Better visual feedback during long operations
- Users can see parallelism in action

### Improved Error Messages
- **Consistent, colored error formatting** across all commands
- Clear "Error:" prefix with red highlighting
- Actionable suggestions with `--help` hints
- Reduced code duplication in error handling

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Quality

### New Test Suite
- Added **5 comprehensive parallel operations tests**:
  - Parallel tap update correctness and performance
  - Parallel upgrade download functionality
  - Parallel API fetch operations
  - Services filtering correctness (cask-only exclusion)
- Total test count: **97 automated tests** (76 unit + 21 integration)

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed services list showing cask-only plists (e.g., tailscale-app)
- Now correctly filters to only show services for installed formulae
- Parity with `brew services list` behavior

## ðŸ“š Documentation

### Updated Performance Benchmarks

### Modern CLI Patterns
- Documented approach to live progress indicators
- Error message best practices
- Clean, modern output formatting
