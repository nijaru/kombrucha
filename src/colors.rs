/// Color support with NO_COLOR and CLICOLOR environment variable handling
///
/// **Current Status**: Detection logic is implemented but owo-colors v4 does not
/// support runtime environment variable checking. This module is ready for when
/// we switch to a color library with proper NO_COLOR support (e.g., `colored`,
/// `termcolor`, or owo-colors v5+).
///
/// **TODO**: Replace owo-colors with a library that properly respects:
/// - NO_COLOR: https://no-color.org/ - If set (to any value), disable colors
/// - CLICOLOR: If set to 0, disable colors
/// - TTY detection: Only output colors if stdout is a terminal
///
/// For now, colors can be disabled by piping output or redirecting stdout,
/// as owo-colors does detect non-TTY outputs.

/// Initialize color support by checking environment variables
///
/// **Note**: Currently a no-op due to owo-colors v4 limitations.
/// The detection logic is implemented and ready for a future color library upgrade.
